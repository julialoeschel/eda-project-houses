# recommendations for client

good month to sell are July, September, December, March and April for the city center

unti August many houses get sold
List them now if you want to sell fast

After renovation you can expect up to a 24% higher price
Depending on amount bedrooms and size and price expectations
for smaller appartments, renovation is not reccomended

If you want to renovate:
After August, prices migth drop , also less houses get sold
If you dont sell the houses to the desired price until August, start renovationimediately
